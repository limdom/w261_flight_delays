The data covers the period from January 2015–December 2021). The LCD data contains summaries of climatological conditions from weather stations managed by the NWS, FAA, and DOD. Since the weather impacts airline flight operations, it is reasonable to assume that weather features may have predictive power in our model for flight delays.\n","\n","We conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the weather set to spot anomalies, calculate the number of missing values, understand the distribution, scale, and range of values of the features, and propose how the features may have explanatory value for our model.\n","\n"," The data includes hourly observations of temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, barometric pressure, sky condition, visibility, and weather phenomena.

The 'HourlyStatonPressure' is the atmospheric pressure observed at the station and reported in inches of Mercury (in Hg). The 'Altimeter setting' is the atmospheric pressure converted to sea level datum and reported in inches of Mercury (in Hg).

This approach uses similarity based on data points that lie nearby the sample data point. KNN employs lazy evaluation, meaning it doesn’t call the dataset until it is needed. The downside to this is that running KNN becomes computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. This can be resolved by caching, but the size of the flights and weather dataset renders this infeasible. Moreover, since the algorithm involves looking at nearby points and different centroids, for a large K, the algorithm makes many passes over the data. Therefore, KNN is not very parallelizable and will not be used.\n","\n","The next approach we considered is decision trees, which is a model that starts with a single point and then branches out by decisions and their subsequent outcomes. With large datasets, we can use the MapReduce framework using each node of decisions as the split. The structure of decision trees is conducive to parallelization because we can represent each level of the tree as a MapReduce job, meaning we can represent data in a decision tree very efficiently. \n","\n","Similar to decision trees, random forests are collections of decisions trees that impart the benefits of decisions trees with additional benefits. Random forests are an ensemble operation, enabling us to test multiple hypotheses with multiple decision trees efficiently. In operation, we would take the training dataset then split it into different partition. Then each partition would have multiple decision trees mapped to different output files. We would then merge these files into the random forest. Given the efficiency at scale and expected performance, we are leaning towards using random forests. \n","We will also consider neural networks (NN) and boosted trees via methods like ADA.\n","\n","#####Metrics  \n","We selected the metrics to evaluate the performance of our models considering the business impact on our customer (the airline) due to decisions made based on incorrect predictions from our model. In addition, since we are using a classification model, we considered the ramifications on the business from false positives and false negatives. \n","\n","We considered the costs incurred by the airline attributed to delays. Airlines must bear the additional costs from their crew, costs for accommodating disrupted passengers, and the costs of aircraft re-positioning. \n","There is also a cost of lost demand from potential customers who consider an airline's reputation for flight delays and customer service before purchasing. Given the competitive nature of the business on specific domestic markets, this cost may be substantial.\n","\n","While our model cannot be used to mitigate the costs of most of these factors, our model can assist the airline in improving its reputation for customer satisfaction in case of delays that disrupt travel. Taking proactive measures to assist passengers may positively impact reputation and have a measurable favorable effect on sales and customer loyalty.\n","\n","The consequences of our model errors in predictions can be summarised as follows:\n","\n","- False positive: The model predicted a delay for the flight, but the flight departed on time. The airline incurred additional expenses to meet a demand that did not materialize. There is no impact on the airline's reputation with its customers. \n","\n","- False negative: The model predicted an on-time departure for the flight, but the flight was delayed. The airline did not allocate resources to handle the surge in demand for staff. Passengers are negatively affected by the wait time to obtain information from the airline, and the airline's reputation with its customers suffers. \n","\n","The impact of these errors depends on the number of passengers and the customer mix of the flight (share of premium passengers and economy passengers). For example, a mainline carrier operating a route with high competition, such as JFK-LAX, with many first-class and business passengers paying the highest fares, may be more interested in avoiding false negative results to retain the loyalty of premium passengers.\n","On the other hand, low-cost carriers operating a leisure route, such as JFK-MCO, may be more interested in reducing customer service costs and prefer a model with fewer false positives.\n","\n","We can use a Fbeta score as a metric, which will allow us to consider giving more weight to either recall or precision to address the needs of our airline.\n","\n","Here is the formal definition of F Beta:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1VqqQB1KwiL1oa3fSrygezE_xSP2hzlwC\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=40%/>\n","\n","#####Baseline Models\n","\n","We will consider two baseline models:\n","- Logistic regression\n","- Assume `NO DELAY` classification"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"e56cf815-aa86-4796-beb0-5686ffef5e91","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["#####Project Key Steps\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1e4xOC48fziq9fNtN8--d68PaXARw4LoT\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=60%/>\n","\n","\n","Block Diagram for Modeling Workflow.

Any normalisations of the data will be done on the training set, and then those values will be applied to the dev and test set in order to avoid any data leaks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"7dcb9b29-f2d4-4dbd-8d2c-ad09b7110e24","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## Section 5: Next Steps:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f27be03f-8da6-442d-ba51-c0b6a3019a65","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["We will conduct the following tasks progressively as the project advances:\n","    \n","- Feature Engineering\n","- Hyperparameter Tuning\n","- Preparation of In-Class Presentation\n","- Selection of Optimal Algorithm \n","- Write Final Report\n","- Final Presentation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"966847a0-8a29-45d0-ae10-4d626cc7aa66","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["Links to EDA notebooks\n","\n","Flight EDA\n","\n","https://adb-731998097721284.4.azuredatabricks.net/?o=731998097721284#notebook/844424046180911/command/4295587629773808\n","\n","https://adb-731998097721284.4.azuredatabricks.net/?o=731998097721284#notebook/4295587629770423/command/4295587629773761\n","\n","Weather EDA\n","\n","https://adb-731998097721284.4.azuredatabricks.net/?o=731998097721284#notebook/364123876153045/command/4295587629773430\n","\n","https://adb-731998097721284.4.azuredatabricks.net/?o=731998097721284#notebook/364123876153144/command/364123876153145"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"3db4f9f3-75fd-40a2-8eda-92a25b201aef","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## Section 6: Open Issues and Problems\n","\n","We have the following open items under active discussion:\n","\n","\n","- We need decide how we will deal with missing values in the features \n","- How will we create the composite key to join the weather and flight data, given the variety of reported frequencies in the weather data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"0fb48a9d-aaec-44d4-b0c1-fd2190750237","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"dashboards":[],"language":"python","notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":4},"notebookName":"Section05_Group04_Deliverable","notebookOrigID":844424046181468,"widgets":{}},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
